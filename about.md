# About RapidPro

## Origins

RapidPro was originally built by a small team of developers at
<a href="http://nyaruka.com/">Nyaruka</a> in Kigali, Rwanda. It
was originally launched as the <a href="https://textit.in">TextIt</a> service which
lives on today and which provides RapidPro as a hosted service.

TextIt was built from the experience that Nyaruka gained from building many
<a href="http://rapidsms.org">RapidSMS</a> systems for various clients. That
experience informed their decision to build a system that was quick to deploy
and which allowed for rapid experimentations of various interventions.

## RapidPro Open Sourcing

In late 2014, Nyaruka partnered with <a href="http://unicef.org">UNICEF</a> to
expand on the capabilities of TextIt and release the source code as RapidPro under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">Affero GPL (AGPL)</a> license.

In brief, the Affero license states you can use the RapidPro source for any project
free of charge, but that any changes you make to the source code **must** be
available to others. Note that unlike the GPL, the AGPL requires these changes
to be made public even if you do not redistribute them. If you host a version of
RapidPro, you **must** make the same source you are hosting available for
others.

RapidPro has dual copyright holders of UNICEF and Nyaruka.

## Commercial Licensing

If you wish to license RapidPro under a different license, you may contact
<a href="http://nyaruka.com/#hire">Nyaruka</a> to discuss your options.
